        <h3>A little bit about me.<h3>

        <p>My full name is Cianenry Danan. I'm Filipino, but I was born in Yokosuka, Japan because my father was stationed there as a sailor. I moved to Marysville, WA in 2003 and have been living here ever since. I’m a huge nerd with a main intererst in video games, anime, fitness and food. Anything shellfish or sushi related is A tier and up on my tier list. I would eat my own weight in shrimp and crab if I were ever given the chance to. I’m not really that interested in fitness. I just wrote that because I go to the gym a couple days a week and ate a salad the other day. Giving piggy back rides to both my kids is also a workout, so I like to think I’m somewhat fit. Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime of all time. After that in no particular order inlcudes One Punch Man, Parasyte, and Attack on Titan. My favorite game genres include puzzle platformers, competetive fps/mobas, survival games and rpgs. I will play literally anything with the right people though. <p>
